          <p>
            I'm a full stack web developer, academic researcher, and advocate with an interest in developing new, community-driven approaches to applying technology to programs for the public good.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I build applications in Rails, JavaScript, React, and React Native with the help of HTML and CSS.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I think the most challenging and exciting part of being a developer is finding simple and elegant solutions and thinking about creative ways to use existing technologies to solve new problems.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I love to write about code, have a tech blog, and am a writer in Hacker Noon.
